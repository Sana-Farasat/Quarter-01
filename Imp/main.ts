If your Instagram account has been hacked, there are steps you can take to attempt to recover it:

Reset Password: If you still have access to the email or phone number associated with your Instagram account, you can request a password reset. Instagram will send you a link or code to reset your password.
Use Login Help: On the Instagram login page, you can select "Need more help?" and follow the prompts to recover your account. This typically involves providing information like your username, email address, or phone number associated with the account.
Contact Instagram Support: If you're unable to recover your account through the above methods, you can contact Instagram's support team for further assistance. You may need to provide proof of identity to verify that you are the rightful owner of the account.
Report the Hack: Instagram has a feature to report hacked accounts. This can help them investigate and potentially recover your account.
Enable Two-Factor Authentication: After recovering your account, enable two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security. This will require a code sent to your phone or email in addition to your password to log in.
Remember to secure your account by using a strong, unique password and being cautious of phishing attempts or suspicious links.

If you've lost access to all the recovery options associated with your Instagram account (email, phone number, and password), recovering it can be more challenging. However, you can still try the following steps:

Username Recovery: Start by attempting to recover your account using your username. On the Instagram login page, click on "Forgot password?" then enter your username. Instagram will then attempt to send a password reset link to the email address associated with your account. If you no longer have access to this email, proceed to the next step.
Contact Instagram Support: If you're unable to reset your password using your username, reach out to Instagram's support team through their Help Center or report the issue using the "Need more help?" option on the login page. Provide them with as much information as possible about your account, such as when you created it, any previous email addresses or phone numbers associated with it, and any recent activity that may help verify your identity.
Proof of Identity: Instagram may require you to provide proof of your identity to confirm that you are the rightful owner of the account. This could include submitting a photo of yourself holding a piece of paper with a code provided by Instagram, or providing other forms of identification.
Be Patient: Recovering a hacked or inaccessible account can take time, especially if you need to go through Instagram's support team. Be patient and provide any requested information promptly to expedite the process.
It's important to note that without access to any of the recovery options, the process of recovering your Instagram account can be more complex and may not always be successful. However, it's worth trying these steps to see if you can regain access to your account.
