/*
chalk.green.bold   , how to use bold and italic property? , how to break loop?
chalk.purple.italic
*/
/*
Changes made:

Set condition to true initially so that the loop executes at least once.
Changed the default value of the "Do you want to continue?" question to false, as the default should be false when the user doesn't want to continue.
Updated the condition based on the user's choice to continue or not.
With these changes, the loop should now execute until the user decides to stop playing.
